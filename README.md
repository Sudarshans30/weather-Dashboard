# weather-Dashboard

#Description
This project uses an openweather API to display weather data to the user based on which city they search for.


Installation
All functionality of this project is contained within the deployed webpage itself. Users can navigate to the following address to experience the project: https://pkeld148.github.io/weather-dashboard/

Usage
When the user navigates to the page, they will be presented with a search box where they can enter the name of a city. After hitting the search button, the app will retrieve current weather information for that city in the main space. Just below that, a 5-day forecast for that city will also be shown. After a user has searched for a city, that city name will populate below the search area and the user may click on those to pull back up the weather data for that city again.
